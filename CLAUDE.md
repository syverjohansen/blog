# Winter Sports Analytics

## Project Development
- Individual Points Testing Adjustments for race picks across multiple winter sports disciplines
  - Read draft race pick scripts for Alpine, Biathlon, Cross-Country, Nordic Combined, and Ski Jump
  - Write methods documentation for race pick approaches in each discipline

## Individual Probability Testing Modeling
- Created draft scripts for race picks in multiple winter sports disciplines
- Prepared to write method documentation for race pick approaches across Alpine, Biathlon, Cross-Country, Nordic Combined, and Ski Jump sports
- Developed comparative analysis framework for individual athlete performance predictions

## Documentation Development
- Created race picks method documentation for cross-country skiing
  - Read draft race pick scripts in weekly-picks2.R and final_climb.R
  - Prepared to write method documentation for cross-country race pick approaches
  - Planned to place cross-country race picks method documentation before the relay section

## Method Documentation Tasks
- Created write targets for race picks method documentation
  - Prepared to write method files at:
    * ~/blog/daehl-e/content/post/cross-country/methods/race-picks.md
    * ~/blog/daehl-e/content/post/methods/race-picks.md
  - Specific focus on cross-country race pick methodology
  - Intended placement: before the relay section in documentation

## Relay Probability Training Modeling
- Expanded race pick methodology to include relay event analysis
- Read draft race pick scripts for multiple winter sports disciplines:
  * Biathlon race picks
  * Cross-Country weekly picks (relay, team sprint, mixed relay)
  * Nordic Combined race picks
  * Ski Jump race picks
- Prepared method documentation for race picks across different winter sports relay formats
- Created write targets for relay race picks method documentation in multiple disciplines
- Added comprehensive file read targets for relay probability training modeling
  * Read scripts for race picks across Biathlon, Cross-Country (weekly picks, relay, team sprint, mixed relay), Nordic Combined, and Ski Jump
- Created write targets for method documentation in multiple disciplines:
  * Biathlon race picks method
  * Cross-Country race picks method
  * Nordic Combined race picks method
  * Ski Jump race picks method
  * General methods race picks documentation
