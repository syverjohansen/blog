1) The catalog issue still persists; this extends to mobile as well
2) My photo not showing up on the home page.  Let's change it to being me.jpg.  
3) On the sport specific pages (daehl-e.com/alpine, biathlon, cross-country, nordic-combined and skijump), the header image at the top is showing the page name which is redundant since it's also at the top of the body section.  Could we get rid of the text in the header image (so the opposite of what we did with Race Picks)
4) Get rid of text for "Weekly Recap for week of ..." at top of body for the weekly recap posts like we did for race-picks (should be in weekly-recap.sh)
5) In the elo page right above Ladies Elo and Men's Elo it says Ladies in small font and Men in small font.  Let's get rid of those.  The all time elo pages don't have this problem.
6) In ranks.html, it appears that Nation is a locked column.  Let's get rid of that and just keep Rank and Skier.  Also let's make it like the elo one where the name gets cut off on mobile (small-table.html and all-table.html)
7) Search is not working right now, let's get rid of that or come up with a solution?  What would the solution be?
8) In the weekly-recap methodology section the Purpose should be: Track the changes in Elo ratings for athletes who have competed in the last week.  We can get rid of the Data Processing part from the Elo Change Tracking section.  For the Season Simulation please put the part after "The system: " in bullets.  Please also specify how many races are used from an athletes history.  Also does the simulation count the participation probability of the athlete for a given event?  I thought it did.  We can leave out the Technical Notes at the bottom.
9) In race-picks methodology, please add a BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) for the file.  Other things: Is the file too verbose?  What could clean it up?  This post should be targeted towards people with data science knowledge, so being too simple is not wanted.  Also there are parts where I think we're trying to use numbers or bullet points, but they aren't showing like this: Full GAM with all BIC-selected variables and flexible smoothing
Simplified GAM with reduced complexity and discipline-specific terms
Linear regression if GAM approaches encounter fitting issues
Simple ELO-only model as the ultimate fallback.  Please look into that and if we need to change the layout of the site to accomodate, let's do that.
10) Elo Calculations Methodology: The exmaple race section is all messed up, let's fix that table.  Same with the season discount section and Sport-Specific K adjustments
11) For all-time rankings methodology, the Base Point Values, Race Type Modifiers, and Complete Points Tables parts are not showing up in the tables.  Output columns is also not showing any entries in the table.
12) In ~/Documents/shrek-preview.md I have written a preview of the Olympics for cross-country skiing for a friend.  Please proofread the file and make any grammatical or stylistic suggestions.  I would also like to create an html file of the md that uses a Winter Olympic theme and emojis next to countries.  I really liked what was done with Users/syverjohansen/fantasy/recap2025.html and should have a similar feel but Winter Olympics instead of fantasy football
