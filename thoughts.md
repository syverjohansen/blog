1) The catalog issue still persists; this extends to mobile as well [NOT FIXED]
4) [NEED TO CHECK ON SUNDAY] Get rid of text for "Weekly Recap for week of ..." at top of body for the weekly recap posts like we did for race-picks (should be in weekly-recap.sh) 
8) [NEED TO CHECK ON SUNDAY] In the weekly-recap methodology section the Purpose should be: Track the changes in Elo ratings for athletes who have competed in the last week.  We can get rid of the Data Processing part from the Elo Change Tracking section.  For the Season Simulation please put the part after "The system: " in bullets.  Please also specify how many races are used from an athletes history.  Also does the simulation count the participation probability of the athlete for a given event?  I thought it did.  We can leave out the Technical Notes at the bottom. 
10) Elo Calculations Methodology: Why is alpine combined K * .8?
12) The links for ladies in the champs predictions are leading to other athletes.  Race-picks is still working correctly.  
13) In race archives all the races are listed as one day before they actually happen.  Why is that?  Something to do with local time vs gmt when they get uploaded?
14) One thing I was thinking about with how predictions and normalizations done is this: Better athletes are punished more for normalization in large races than smaller athletes.  Take us predicting this Olympics in champs-predictions.R.  The position probabilities are usually based on a standard size race (say 70 people).  In the champs predictions there are 130 people in the pool.  So during normalization, it is almost guaranteed that the raw probabilities will be above 100% of the target.  Now let's say we're mesauring top-30.  If Johannes Klaebo gets 98% for top-30 in the raw calculation, after normalizatoin he is down to 70-something percent.  That is probably not reflective of reality since the Olympics will include many skiers that are not usually on the circuit and have no chance of beating him.  If you are best in the world, your chances of top-30 should not change based on the size of the field.  What are some ways we can account for this?
**) In ~/Documents/shrek-preview.md I have written a preview of the Olympics for cross-country skiing for a friend.  Please proofread the file and make any grammatical or stylistic suggestions.  I would also like to create an html file of the md that uses a Winter Olympic theme and emojis next to countries.  I really liked what was done with Users/syverjohansen/fantasy/recap2025.html and should have a similar feel but Winter Olympics instead of fantasy football
