# 2025-26 Season Preview

## Introduction

Welcome to the 2025-26 Biathlon season!  The start of a Bø-less era in the men's biathlon and new faces in an already croweded ladies' field all in an Olympics year should make for one of the most intriguing seasons in Biathlon World Cup History.

With Johannes Thingnes Bø gone, all eyes will be on Sturla Holm Lægreid to see if he can become the new dynasty following nearly 30 years of Bjørndalen, Fourcade and Bø.  However, it will not be without fierce competition from younger competitors such as Eric Perrot and Tomasso Giacomel.

On the ladies' side, the previous two seasons have come down to the final weekend to decide the Crystal Globe.  With no clear favorite and 10+ women capable of winning the overall, that may be the case again.

The scope of this post is just the individual World Cup season.  The Olympics will have their own prediction posts shortly before they come around.

Out of the skiing disciplines, biathlon seems to be the most consistent season to season.  The 2025-26 season will not have much difference compared to recent seasons on what race types are on the calendar.  However, biathlon race types do not matter as much as cross-country or alpine, so it would likely not make much of a difference if there was for example, more Sprint races than usual.
