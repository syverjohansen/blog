## World Cup Standings Predictions

### Background

In Part 2, I will be giving the overall standings predictions as a proportion of maximum World Cup points as well as the odds for each skier to get top-1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 in the overall World Cup.

The Elo data is calculated from race data going back to 1920.  Race data includes World Cups, World Championships, and Olympic Winter Games as well as a handful of Holmenkollen races prior to the World Cup era that began in 1982.  Elo scores are calculated for overall Elo, as further broken down into distance, distance classic, distance freestyle, sprint, sprint classic, sprint freestyle, classic, and freestyle.  A separate post about how Elo is calculated will be made.

In addition to Elo scores, I also considered the percent of maximum points a skier had in the previous season, their age, and World Cup racing experience.  The skiers included in these lists are the ones who competed in 10 or more races in the 2023-24 World Cup season.  This was to avoid skiers who either do not get starts because their national teams are so strong (Sindre Skar) or older skiers who only race at major events (like what Justyna Kowalczyk used to do).  Obviously, this means that Therese Johaug will not be shown in the data tables below, but more on her later.

One thing that should be considered when viewing this data is that it only considers historical results and how one's current Elo scores and recent race history predicts their outcome in the following season.  It cannot predict illness, injury, fatigue, offseason training, or a number of other factors when determing its results.  For example, while Klæbo is the runaway favorite for the overall World Cup, the possibility of skipping the Tour de Ski, missing weekends to prepare for a major championship, and the new scoring method for World Cup races that favor participation over winning, all mean that there is chance for these to way off for any one skier.



### Season Points Predictions


#### Men

For men, Klæbo is unsuprisingly the heavy favorite on paper.  Currently, he is the top in the world in every category except for distance freestyle (where he is a close second).  However, with the facts that he has already won 4 World Cup overalls, and that the World Championships are in his backyard, there's a good chance he may decide to skip out on some racing in the early/middle season to prepare for Trondheim.  

Harald Østberg Amundsen's is predicted to regress this upcoming season.  While still expected to be the second best skier in the world, an overall win is unlikely (just as it was last season).  The reason for his overall win last year comes down to a few factors.  1) Incredible performances in a couple of sprint and classic races, 2) racing every race, 3) Klæbo missing several races and the TdS.  Given his improvement in classic racing last year, I wouldn't be completely surprised for him to continue to improve and be near the top in classic more frequently this year.  

For "regressing-to-the-mean", look towards Friedrich Moch and Hugo Lapalus.  Although still young skiers from non-Norway nations (meaning lots of starts), with heavy probability to improve, their standing last year was bolstered heavily by podium results in Tour de Ski that pretty much came down to the last stage.  TdS is hard to predict pre-season, and even harder when you're not a top-3 skier in the world.  This means that there is solid odds of them finishing anywhere from 3-15.  Luckily for them, they will always have the final climb to look forward to.  Unfortunately, that advantage goes away with 1 bad stage prior.

#### Ladies

For ladies, Diggins is still the favorite to win the overall.  Her combination of racing everything on the schedule, best in the world distance freestyle, and no weakness in the other disciplines leaves her always near the top in the overall standings.  The biggest threats to her overall title will likely comes from a few factors.

1) Improvement from Swedish skiers.  Any improvement from Swedish skiers leaves Diggins vulnerable even at her best to the likes of Frida Karlsson, Linn Svahn, and Jonna Sundling.  Linn Svahn and Sundling have gone from sprint specialists to hybrid skiers in recent years.  More consistent racing in distance for them will make it more difficult for Diggins to hoist the Crystal Globe.

2) Inconsistent results in classic/diminished sprint ability.  Unsurprisingly, Diggins herself is a huge factor in how her own season goes!  In the past she's been prone to poor results in classic races.  Coupled with the fact that sprinting gets tougher with age, it may be more difficult for Diggins to sustain the level she displayed last season.

3) Presence of Therese Johaug.  Johaug is back this season which means that the whole race dynamics change in distance races.  Instead of a pace near the front that all the top skiers can handle, Johaug sets such a demanding pace from the start that strings out the rest of the field.  This is especially tough for Diggins in the classic races and can lead to poorer results than she's used to.

## World Cup Odds Predictions


#### Men

Once again, Klæbo is the clear odds favorite with Amundsen, Valnes, and Golberg the other serious contenders.  Don't expect to see any surprises on the Overall Podium this season.

#### Ladies

The overall will be a tough battle between Diggins and the Swedes.  Look to Brennan, Niskanen, and Carl to have a shot at the Overall Podium.
