## World Cup Standings Predictions

### Background

In Part 2, I will be giving the overall standings predictions as a proportion of maximum World Cup points as well as the odds for each skier to get top-1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 in the overall World Cup.

The Elo data is calculated from race data going back to 1920.  Race data includes World Cups, World Championships, and Olympic Winter Games as well as a handful of Holmenkollen races prior to the World Cup era that began in 1982.  Elo scores are calculated for overall Elo, as further broken down into distance, distance classic, distance freestyle, sprint, sprint classic, sprint freestyle, classic, and freestyle.

In addition to Elo scores, I also considered the percent of maximum points a skier had in the previous season, their age, and World Cup racing experience.  The skiers included in these lists are the ones who competed in the 2024-25 World Cup season and are not listed on the retirement list on the 2024-25 FIS Cross-Country World Cup Wikipedia page.  Unfortunately, this means the Russians are not included in these predictions, although if you keep reading, they will be listed.

One thing that should be considered when viewing this data is that it only considers historical results and how one's current Elo scores and recent race history predicts their outcome in the following season.  It cannot predict illness, injury, fatigue, offseason training, or a number of other factors when determing its results.  For example, while Klæbo is the runaway favorite for the overall World Cup, the possibility of skipping the Tour de Ski, missing weekends to prepare for a major championship, and the new scoring method for World Cup races that favor participation over winning, all mean that there is chance for these to way off for any one skier.



### Season Points Predictions


#### Men

##### Johannes Høsflot Klæbo (NOR, 29)

Last season Klæbo crowned himself as the greatest male cross-country skier of all time in 2025 after winning 6 gold medals at the World Championships in Trondheim and his 5th Overall World Cup.  With the Russians gone and Klæbo still in his prime, if the focus is there, Klæbo could easily tie Bjørn Dæhlie's 6 Crystal Globes this season, all before the age of 30.  The if there is pretty big though.  Cross-country skiing notoriously has the toughest scoring breakdown when it comes to missing races.  If Klæbo is ill, injured, or misses the Tour de Ski, all of which he has experienced in the past, he is prone to lose the World Cup.  Additionally, if he has a skiing hangover following his historic World Championships in Trondheim, it is possible he is upset again by someone like Amundsen.

##### Harald Østberg Amundsen (NOR, 27)

##### Federico Pellegrino (ITA, 35)

##### Edvin Anger (SWE, 23)

##### Erik Valnes (NOR, 29)

Klæbo is once again the heavy favorite on paper.  He is the most dominant cross-country skier of all time and is expected to win every race he enters.  This was on display in Trondheim where he won 6/6 golds including a 50km freestyle in the most anti-Klaebo conditions.  Likely the only thing that will stop Klæbo from winning this season are 1) Russians returning and stronger (natural or not) than ever, 2) he has an understandable hangover from the home World Championships, or more likely 3) he does not participate in races at the high rate demanded by the current scoring system.

After Klæbo look to similar names from last season.  As I predicted last year, Harald Østberg Amundsen failed to repeat as the overall World Cup champion.  Pulling out of the Tour de Ski did him no favors, but he would not have won regardless.  He is still predicted to be Klæbo's top challenger.  After Amundsen, Federico Pellegrino, Edvin Anger, and Erik Valnes are all clustered as contenders.  None of these men are likely to win the Tour de Ski, making their odds much lower.

Last year, I predicted that Friedrich Moch and Hugo Lapalus would regress to the mean.  For Lapalus, I was dead wrong.  However, Moch did drop to his predicted regression.  Lapalus has proven himself to be a highly consistent distance racer in both freestyle and classic.  Furthermore, he competes for a nation who will put him out there every World Cup weekend.  I expect him to be in a cluster with Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget, William Poromaa, Mika Vermeulen, Gus Schumacher, and Ben Ogden this year.  If someone has high drop-off potential, look to Simen Hegstad Krüger.  Although like Moch and Lapalus, Krüger is likely to crush Tour de Ski points, aging, continuous competition in distance races, and fewer classic starts could mean a tougher season for Krüger.

#### Ladies

##### Jessie Diggins (USA, 34)

##### Jonna Sundling (SWE, 30)

##### Kerttu Niskanen (FIN, 37)

##### Frida Karlsson (SWE, 26)

##### Astrid Øyre Slind (NOR, 37)

Jessie Diggins remains a magnet for the Crystal Globe and tops the prediction list for the ladies.  Her performance last season was one of the better of all time in terms of accumulating points.  Although one cannot assume the same level of performance, remaining near the top of the leaderboards and higher comparitive start rate than her competitiors means that Diggins is the woman to beat this season.  In terms of how she can be beat.

1) Higher start rate by the Swedish women.  This is unlikely.  Not only do the Swedes tend to try to peak for the championships by having their top skiers miss much of the middle of the season, their women have had consistent injury issues in recent years.  I'm not expecting any of their top skiers to be lining up for the Alpe Cermis to win the Tour de Ski in January.

2) Injuries.  Diggins had foot issues last season that kept her from Classic racing in the middle of the season.  If those injuries persist, the USA coaches might pull her from races in preparation for the Olympics.  Last season's World Championships were a disaster for Diggins, that she will not to repeat.  I would not be surprised if they try a different preparation for the Olympics from what they did before Worlds last season.
