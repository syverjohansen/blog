## World Cup Standings Predictions

### Background

In Part 2, I will be giving the overall standings predictions as a proportion of maximum World Cup points as well as the odds for each skier to get top-1, 3, and 10 in the overall World Cup.

The Elo data is calculated from race data going back to 1931. Race data includes World Cups, World Championships, and Olympic Winter Games as well as some races prior to the World Cup era that began in 1966-67. Elo scores are calculated for overall Elo, as further broken down into Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom, Speed, and Technical.

In addition to Elo scores, I also considered the percent of maximum points a skier had in the previous season, their age, and World Cup racing experience. The skiers included in these lists are the ones who competed in the 2024-25 World Cup season and are not listed on the retirement list on the 2024-25 FIS Alpine World Cup Wikipedia page.

One thing that should be considered when viewing this data is that it only considers historical results and how one's current Elo scores and recent race history predicts their outcome in the following season. It cannot predict illness, injury, fatigue, offseason training, or a number of other factors when determining its results.

### Season Points Predictions

#### Men

Unsurprisingly, Marco Odermatt is the favorite to win the overall title in 2025-26. After 4 straight years of dominance as an all-around skier, it would be surprising if Odermatt loses the title this season.

If Odermatt is unable to win this season, Loic Meillard, Henrik Kristoffersen and Lucas Braathen are the next contenders. However, with all of them vying for the same technical points race after race, it seems unlikely to happen.

#### Ladies

Mikaela Shiffrin and Federica Brignone are the favorites for the 2025-26 season. With Brignone as the reigning champion and Shiffrin back from multiple seasons of injury, this should be a tight battle for the overall. Not far behind them there is a group of Sofia Goggia, Lara Gut-Behrami, Sara Hector, and Alice Robinson. Gut-Behrami has won the Crystal Globe twice previously, but took a distant second to Brignone last year.

## World Cup Odds Predictions

#### Men

Odermatt is an untouchable favorite to win the overall. The reason why the Win, Top-3, and Top-10 are all similar in odds is due to normalization to ensure percentages remain under 100% and that the numbers add up to 100% (in the case of top-10, 1000%). Also there is some effect of heteroscedasticity here that causes outlier skiers like Odermatt to be undervalued at the top-10 level.

#### Ladies

Gut-Behrami is the favorite to win the overall in the odds prediction, followed by Brignone and Shiffrin. This may be a sample size error of finding winners (only using back to 2016), or it may be the case that the winner does usually fit Gut-Behrami's current skillset.
